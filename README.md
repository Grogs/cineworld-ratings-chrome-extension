====
The Cineworld Unlimited card is pretty awesome, but I always find myself checking every films IMDb rating. Too manual; I want to see the ratings inline. So I created a Chrome extension: [Cineworld Ratings](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cineworld-ratings/aeihmofihjacjlkecnjpoicmaaandnnc).
